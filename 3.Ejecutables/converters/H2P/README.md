# H2P (obsolete)
(hexa dicom binario transformed to Apple plist)

The parsing is an array of four synchronized array headstrings,bodystrings,headdatas,bodydatas.
data contains the binary corresponding to strings.

incomplete but working proof of concept.
Abandonned because plist is not as universal as json.
