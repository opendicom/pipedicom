# P2D (obsolete)

(Apple plist to dicom binary)

Very simple transformation joining headdata and corresonding bodydata for each attribute and then joining all the attributes together.

Uses the segmented binary which was kept in coordination to the parsing of each attribute.

Together with H2P or D2P, provides a very fast solution for attribute removing.

For the other editing use cases may require an additional module to translate strings to datas.

Abandonned because plist is abandoned.
